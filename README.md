These are some of my past programming projects that I made in middle and high school. 

Crossy Road: My code is an imitation of the mobile game "Crossy Road" which is also similar to "Frogger," an older game. The player dodges dangerous cars in an attempt to get to the other side. It is coded in Pascal. I created this in eighth grade for a school computer science fair, so it is one of my earliest large projects. I haven't edited the code since then besides the comments
  
Doodle Jump: My code is an imitation of the moblie game "Doodle Jump." The player bounces off platforms to reach higher heights and scores. It runs using Java and Processing, and uses sprite sheets and background images from Doodle Jump. I included the sprite sheets I used in this repository. I downloaded them from www.spriters-resource.com. I created this in the summer of 2018 to practice coding and for fun.
  
Pong Pong: My code is an imitation of "Pong Pong," a game on the Internet. The game is similar to classic Pong but every time the ball hits a paddle it splits into two. It runs using Java and Processing. I created this in the summer of 2018 to practice coding and for fun.
